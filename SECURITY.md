# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities as needed. There is no formal versioning schedule.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Email the maintainers (or open a private security advisory if the repo supports it) with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

3. Allow a reasonable time (e.g. 90 days) for a fix before public disclosure.

## Scope

- **In scope**: Atrium backend (FastAPI), frontend (Next.js), PDF processing, and data handling.
- **Out of scope**: Third-party dependencies (report to their maintainers); general usage questions.

## Acknowledgments

We thank security researchers who report issues responsibly.
